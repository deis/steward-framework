# Steward

This repository contains the original Deis-built Proof of Concept for a Kubernetes-native Service Broker.
Given broad interest in the Service Catalog space, Deis has joined forces with Google, Red Hat, IBM and others, under the [Service Catalog special interest group](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog).

Ongoing development is now happening in the [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) repository. 

The original concepts which informed Deis' upstream involvement live in [README-OLD.md](./README-OLD.md).

## Getting Involved
